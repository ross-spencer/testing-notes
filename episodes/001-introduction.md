## Know what you’ve got (Why are we interested in identifying file formats?)

* Knowing what you’ve got is a basic first step for managing digital
information - whether that’s records management, managing digital
continuity or Digital Preservation
* Our aim is to keep our digital information useful and usable.
* For ‘useful’ we usually think about managing the provenance and context of
digital information - where it came from, what it’s for, what it means…. This
work is often done by records managers or cataloguers.
* To keep digital information usable, we need to understand its technical
characteristics. Identifying file formats with confidence is a first step in
planning to keep those records usable - ensuring access to tools or services
that make the records possible to open, render or search in the future. This
is at the heart of digital preservation.
* This is detailed work. The precise format (e.g. what version of Word or PDF
do we have?) can be important.

## How can we identify file formats?

* There’s not one single method

### What tool was used?

* You may simply know what tools or software were used to create your
digital records (e.g. you know what camera was used by a project or what
word processor was available at the time). But usually we don’t know this
with any confidence, particularly if the records were created a long time
ago or came from outside the organisation.

### File extensions

* File extensions can be very helpful. But they can be changed and they
don’t usually tell us about specific versions.

### Looking inside the files

* We need to look inside the digital files, at the precise sequence of
codes in the file. Sometimes the file format is plainly stated inside the
file. More often we will be looking for characteristic patterns that point
us towards an identification. These patterns are known as file format
signatures. The starts and ends of files are good places to look for
these patterns.
* Some file formats have a formal specification - like a set of rules
detailing how these files should be constructed. Only files that conform
to the specification are ‘valid’ examples of that file format. If we have
access to the specification, it can help us with signature development.
The specification will define patterns that we can look for. But reality
is more complicated than this: the software products used to create the
files may not implement the specification correctly. We may see examples of
files that seem to work just fine (i.e. they can be opened, viewed, edited
using the relevant software) but if our identification relies on just the
rules in the specification, we won’t get a match. It can help us to know
whether or not a file is a valid example of the format - because invalid
files may be at greater risk of being unusable in the future, if a new
generation of the software is stricter.
* So, when creating signatures, we should review the specification if it’s
available. But we usually want to look beyond the specification. Ideally,
we should also look at examples of real files, from different sources if
possible.
* Because of this variation, file format research is both an art and a
science. Looking for patterns in files is a fairly structured activity.
Making a judgment about how strict to be or when to be flexible is more of
an art. If we make the signature too strict, we’ll fail to identify some
real examples. If we make it too flexible, we’ll generate false
identifications.

## PRONOM

* These file format signatures are useful to all of us. We have a central
registry of signatures - this is PRONOM.
* PRONOM is hosted and managed by The UK National Archives for the benefit
of the whole digital preservation community. It’s free to use.
* PRONOM is used by people and also by software tools to help us identify the
file formats in our digital collections.
* The National Archives didn’t research or create all the signatures in
PRONOM. Since the start of the digital age, there have been a huge number of
file formats in use. No one institution could possibly research them all. The
file format signatures in PRONOM have been contributed by researchers from
across the global digital preservation community. It’s a shared resource,
created by the community for the community.
* PRONOM is not comprehensive, far from it. Although the most common file
formats are covered, at some point in your digital preservation work you
will encounter a file format that doesn’t have a signature in PRONOM. Or
you may find that a signature exists, but it doesn’t work well for the files
in your collection.
* This is when you will embark on researching and creating a new signature -
which is what we’re going to look at in the following sections.
* Once you’ve created a new file format signature, please contribute it to
PRONOM!

<!-- NB. Keypoints should appear at the end of the markdown file. Aesthetically
     it looks like it's better with an additional newline so adding that
     here and using this comment as a separator to make it easy to read
     content.

By the end of this workshop, you should be able to:

* Identify container files.
* Navigate the contents of container files.
* Create a container signature.
* Use the container signature to identify your files.
* Contribute your signatures to PRONOM

It isn't just the beginning of your PRONOM journey, it's the beginning
of your digital forensics journey!
