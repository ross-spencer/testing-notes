## Carpentries Workbench

This lesson uses the amazing template from
[The Carpentries Workbench][workbench].

[workbench]: https://carpentries.github.io/sandpaper-docs/

### Building the workbench

The repository is supported by a [`justfile`][just-1]. The easiest way to
install `just` is to first install `cargo` and then run `cargo install just`.

See [these instructions][just-2] for more information on installing `cargo`.

Once you have installed `just` run the commands `just inspect-deps` to
check your current dependencies. Run `just deps` to install all those that
are required by the site.

`just workbench` will build and launch the tutorial on a local port.

Running `just` on its own will show all available commands.
